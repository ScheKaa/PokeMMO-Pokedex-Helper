# PokeMMO Pokedex Helper

This project is a Pokedex Helper designed for PokeMMO, providing tools and utilities to enhance the gameplay experience. It includes features for Pokedex management, catch rate calculations, and recommendations for the best catchers.

## Features

- **Pokedex Management:** Keep track of your Ingame Pokedex.
- **Pokedex Filtering:** Various filter option, e.g. pheno 'Special Only' Pokemon.
- **Catch Rate Calculator:** Calculate the probability of catching a Pokemon based on various factors.
- **Best Catching Spot Recommendations:** Identify optimal location for catching Pokemon
- **Profile Managment:** Create different profiles for different Accounts
- **Browser Stored:** Progress is browser stored, you can export/import your progress in case you need to switch your browser.

## Usage

Clicking on a Picture in Pokedex view or 'Best Catching Spots' marks a Pokemon as caught,
by clicking on a caught Pokemon again, it gets 'released'

## Notes

Sadly the Pokedex of PokeMMO is not that good, e.g. it shows a location for Pokemon, but not exactly where, a good example are
Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan both can be caught in Kanto Victory Road, but not on the save floor.

Unova shows "Old Rod" but there is no Old Rod, just use "Super Rod"

## Credits

dex.json, catchRates.json, location.json and the base of the catching formula were used from https://github.com/PokeMMO-Tools/pokemmo-hub. Maybe a bit more I do not remember, sorry.
