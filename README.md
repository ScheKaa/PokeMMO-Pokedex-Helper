# PokeMMO Pokedex Helper

This project is a Pokedex Helper designed for PokeMMO, providing tools and utilities to enhance the gameplay experience. It includes features for Pokedex management, catch rate calculations, and recommendations for the best catchers.

## Features

- **Pokedex Management:** Keep track of your Pokemon collection.
- **Catch Rate Calculator:** Calculate the probability of catching a Pokemon based on various factors.
- **Best Catcher Recommendations:** Identify optimal location for catching Pokemon
- **User Authentication:** Secure user profiles and data.

## Notes

Sadly the Pokedex of PokeMMO is not that good, e.g. it shows a location for Pokemon, but not exactly where, a good example are
Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan both can be caught in Kanto Victory Road, but not on the save floor.

Unova shows "Old Rod" but there is no Old Rod, just use "Super Rod"

## Credits

dex.json, catchRates.json, location.json and the base of the catching formula were used from https://github.com/PokeMMO-Tools/pokemmo-hub. Maybe a bit more I do not remember, sorry.
